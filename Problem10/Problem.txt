Diamond tracking (Easy version)

Richard and his team are working on a decentralized diamond trading platform.
They plan to use blockchain technology to record the ownership of each diamond and ensure that there are no fake diamonds in the market.
Richard has hired you to write a smart contract for their platform that will help them keep track of the diamonds based on their weight.

Write a smart contract that has the following public functions:

Input:
importDiamonds(uint[] memory weights): This function takes an array of unsigned integers that 
represent the weights of the diamonds being imported. It is guaranteed that the weight of each 
diamond will be in the range 0 <= weight <=1000.

Output:
availableDiamonds(uint weight): This function takes an unsigned integer that represents the 
weight of the diamonds being queried. The function should return the number of diamonds that 
have the specified weight. It is guaranteed that the total number of diamonds never exceed 2^256.

Help Richard and his team in their mission to revolutionize the diamond industry by providing 
them with a smart contract that will enable them to keep track of the diamonds on their platform.
