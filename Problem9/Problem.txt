Pythagoras Theorem

Given 3 numbers, we want to check wheather it is possible to create a right angled triangle
such that the lengths of the 3 sides of the triangle are same as the 3 numbers.
Create a smart contract which has the following public function :

 
OUTPUT:-
function check(uint a, uint b, uint c) returns (uint): This function must return true if
it is possible for a right angled triangle to have the sides of length equal a, b and c respectively.
If not, then it must return false.
